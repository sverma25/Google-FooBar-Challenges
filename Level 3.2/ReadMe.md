<h1>Find the Access Codes</h1>

<p>Given a list (from 1 to 2000 elements) of random integers (from 1 to 999999) write a function, answer(l) that accepts a list as input and returns the number of "lucky triples" present in the list.</p>

<p>For this purpose, a lucky triple is defined as a list of three numbers (x,y,z) such that x divides y, y divides z, and x≤y≤z. So, for instance, (2,4,8) is a lucky triple and so is (1,1,1).</p>

<h2>Test cases:</h2>

<p><b>Input:</b> [1, 1, 1]
<br />
<b>Ouput:</b> 1</p>

<p><b>Input:</b> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
<br />
<b>Output:</b> 3</p>
